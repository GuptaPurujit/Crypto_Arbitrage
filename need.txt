BINANCE API/ WEBSOCKET
How the binance websocket works -> It return an output when the candle closes i.e. every 1 min and is in the same real time speed as https://binance.com/en/trade

--> So the binance api is real time
    ISSUE 
    --> for us to move to another coin we have to wait for the candle to close for that particular coin
    --> The price is against USDT, some of the USDT coins are not available in INR.


WAZIRX API
--> Thing to think of
    --> find a way to test if the wazirx data is real time or not 
    --> test the data for a particular coin
